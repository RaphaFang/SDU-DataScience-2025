# Matrix Transformation, T(x) = Ax
    # A, the matrix representation of T()

# We transformation a vector by a matrix and get the trans-ed vector as result.
# If the transformation is linear, means
    # T(x) + T(y) = T(x + y)
    # aT(x) = T(ax)

# We can take the previous sample as a tool to build the corresponding system,
# which will be able to give us the formula for us to get the new vector we like to submit.

# we can also do SoT(x) like what we learned in Discrete,
    # in this case make sure the order of representation matrix of S() = Ax and T() = Bx
    # SoT = ABx, ToS = BAx

# inverses matrix, SoT(x) = AB(x) = x = BA(x) = ToS(x)
# A-1 @ A @ x = Ix = A @ A-1 @ x
